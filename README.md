## About <a name= "about"></a>
Learning Japanese opens the door to a rich language and culture shaped by unique characters. Japanese uses three writing systems—hiragana, katakana, and kanji—each with its own role. Together they form the foundation for learning Japanese.


There are 46 hiragana and the dataset is composed of 100 images of the 46 hiraganas.

Writing the characters involves a series of strokes that goes from top to bottom.
